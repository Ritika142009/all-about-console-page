<h1>Project on Console</h1>
<h3>Console screen is where we would find the code of jawascript.</h3>

<h2>How to open a console screen?</h2>
<p>This is a basic question. To open a console screen, we have to right-click on the empty space of a website
    and, click on inspect. Then, it would show a pop up screen, shown as elements. You would find the name
    console on the right hand side, next to the elements. If you click on console, your console page would be 
    opened.</p>

<h2>How do we print anything on console?</h2>
<p>For the first step, you have to download the visualstudio app. After downloading, you would find a lego 
    blocks like logo on the left hand side. Click on that, and type "Live Server". Once, it is installed, 
    click the settings button near uninstall. And scroll down a bit and search for "null". If you click on null,
    then you could find options to check your project in a browser.
    <br>
    Now, create a folder and rename as you wish, then come back to vsc and click on file. Once clicked you would 
    find various options. you have to click on the Open Folder option. then select the folder you want to start
    your project. then, you would find a blank screen on the left hand side. Right click and select the Open file
    option and name it. Then you can start printing codes on console under the "script" tag. And to save everything
    again click on file. later, click on save all option under file. Next you find a option GO LIVE below, in the
